# ITCH_Parser
In development, done purely in the programable logic of the Nexy A7 without the use of a processor. My aim with this project is to interact with the RMII PHY chip on the Nexys A7 to allow for reception of ethernet data packets. I'll also write the MAC IP that strips the appropiate headers. I'll then parse the raw ITCH payload using a custom IP
